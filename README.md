Wallgrabber
===========
 Simply script written in Python 3, which I use for setting random anime-wallpaper.
 It grabs pages with links on pictures from Konachan, than parse it and create list of links.
 It can be used for automatic downloading archives of pics.
 Working only with Python 3.


Features
===========
 + Download at once only links on wallpapers, not pictures(usable for slow connection).
 + Censored or uncut pictures.
 + Multi-tags.
 + Changeable number of pages to downoad.


Installation
===========
  - Download archive.
  - In your home-directory create directory ".wallgrabber".
  - Unpack archive in ".wallgrabber" directory(paths are be like "/*user-directory*/.wallgrabber/Tag_parser.py", etc.)
  - See readme for how-to-use info.
