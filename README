Tag parser -  script, which can grab pages with links on pictures
from Konachan. Working only with Python 3(but it can be ported on python 2).

How to use:
    Run srcipt from terminal with command:
        $ python3 /way_to_script/.wallgrabber/Tag_parser.py
        Insert tags, which you wish to see on your wallpaper.
        Insert number of pages(so many pictures, as many of pages).

        Script will download links on pictures to text file in directory, which named "/lists".

        Than you can use second part of script for downloading and installation
        or use lists create with Tag_parser with your own script.


Config - file, where you can set tag to use. Just replace example tag with your disire tag(which is already created by Tag_parser.py!).

How to use:
    In the prompt, type the following code:
       crontab -e

    where *user* is name of user dir.
    Save new config and after that every 1 hour script will be download and install new wallpaper.
